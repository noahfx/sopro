You Found Society Pro!
======================

Society Pro's **vision** is...

...philosophically:  
   to provide a private and secure space to meet, trade, work, and play.

...technically:  
   federated networks of peers that follow agreed-upon protocols;
   high level APIs for messaging, crypto, digital assets, smart contracts, reputation;
   where users *self-own* their data and cryptographic identities.

...physically:  
   a tool for *roommates* to document house rules, split rent, and write IOUs;  
   a tool for *companies* to incorporate, communicate, and execute;  
   a tool for *cities* to run elections, coordinate an emergency response, or automate public transit payments


As of 0.1.12, the **reality** of Society Pro is...
...a non-federated, multi-user, material design chat program WIP
